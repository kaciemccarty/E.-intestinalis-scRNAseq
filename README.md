#Abstract
Microsporidia are single-celled intracellular parasites that cause opportunistic diseases in
humans. Encephalitozoon intestinalis is a prevalent human-infecting species that invades the
small intestine. Dissemination to other organ systems is also observed, and is potentially
facilitated by macrophages. The macrophage response to infection and the developmental
trajectory of the parasite are not well studied. Here we use single cell RNA sequencing to
investigate transcriptional changes in both the host and parasite during infection. While a small
population of infected macrophages mount a response, most remain transcriptionally
unchanged, suggesting that the majority of parasites may avoid host detection. The parasite
transcriptome reveals large transcriptional changes throughout the life cycle, providing a
blueprint for parasite development. The stealthy microsporidian lifestyle likely allows these
parasites to harness macrophages for replication and dissemination. Together, our data provide
insights into the host response in primary human macrophages and the E. intestinalis
developmental program.
